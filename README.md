## Prerequisites

- Basic understanding of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
- Install the [React DevTools](https://react.dev/learn/react-developer-tools)

## Pre-workshop Resources

Here are some resources you can read before taking the workshop to get you up to
speed on some of the tools and concepts we'll be covering:

- [JavaScript to Know for React](https://kentcdodds.com/blog/javascript-to-know-for-react)

## System Requirements

- [git][git] v2.18 or greater
- [NodeJS][node] v20 or greater
- [npm][npm] v8 or greater

All of these must be available in your `PATH`. To verify things are set up
properly, you can run this:

```shell
git --version

```

If you have trouble with any of these, learn more about the PATH environment
variable and how to fix it here for [windows][win-path] or
[mac/linux][mac-path].

## Setup

Use the Epic Workshop CLI to get this setup:

```sh nonumber
